Research on Spreads and Moneylines for the 2020-2021 NBA Season. 

Project for DS3000 - Foundations of Data Science

The goal of our project is to predict if the home team covers the spread in a certain basketball game to help sports bettors. We
would also like to learn more about Vegas odds and how they skew odds in their favor. Using our predictions
and our gained insight on Vegas odds, we can better identify which betting lines are poorly constructed and
could be exploited. In essence, this would create a “money machine” that could repeatedly predict strong bets
for bettors to take advantage of.

Our dataset represents all NBA games from the 2020-2021 season. We have a few target variables, since
there are multiple items to bet on. These targets include money line data, spread, turnover percentage, effective field goal percentage per team and many more.  With these multiple features, we can analyze which teams are most likely to “cover the spread”which teams are likely to contribute to a higher total score, which teams are most consistent to win as the favorite, etc. Using machine learning algorithms, we will be able to create a model that predicts whether a team covers the spread or not, as described above, and exploit certain aspects of it to hopefully, obtain a positive cash flow.
